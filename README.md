If you're diving into Redux, here’s a quick breakdown:

1️⃣ Create a Store – The central place to manage the application's state.
2️⃣ Define Reducers (Slices) – In Redux Toolkit, we use slices to define reducers and actions.
3️⃣ Export Reducers – First, export them individually for component use, then combine and add them to the store.
4️⃣ Integrate Reducers with Store – Import and configure them in the store.
5️⃣ Build Components – Components interact with the store using useSelector and useDispatch.
6️⃣ Dispatch Actions – Actions update the store via reducers.
7️⃣ Access Values – Use useSelector to read state and useDispatch to trigger actions.
8️⃣ Action Payloads – Any updated values are stored in action.payload.

🔹 Key Takeaway: To perform an action, it must be dispatched properly to update the store.
